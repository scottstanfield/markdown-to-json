# markdown-to-json

![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/scottstanfield/markdown-to-json)

Tool for converting YAML Front Matter in Markdown files to JSON files.

`m2j` is used to read a folder of Markdown files, pulling out the YAML
Front Matter from each, and saving it all as a JSON blob.

This is especially useful if you have a folder full of Markdown files
that you want scanned and processed into a single JSON file, which can
then be consumed by Angular on the client, cached in a Node server, or
saved in a NoSQL database.

In addition to moving the YAML to JSON, a few extra elements are created: 

-  `iso8601` [formatted][1] timestamp from `date` using [Moment.js][2]
-  `preview` is the first 70 or so characters of the actual raw Markdown content, with ellipses at the end
-  `basename` is the filename without the path or extension
-  `content` is created only if the content flag is enabled; raw Markdown content will be unabridged

_Example_

```
% m2j --help

  Usage: m2j [options] <files>

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number
    -w --width <int>         max width of preview text [70]. Set to 0 for no preview.
    -p --pretty              format JSON with newlines
    -c --content             include the full content of the file unabridged
    -o --outfile <filename>  filename to save json to [output.json]
