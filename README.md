# Markdown YAML front-matter to JSON

`m2j.js` is used to read a folder of Markdown files, pulling out the YAML front matter from each, and saving it all as a JSON object.

This is especially useful if you have a folder full of Markdown files
that you want scanned and processed into a single JSON file, which can
then be consumed by Angular on the client, cached in a Node server, or
saved in a nosql database.

In addition to moving the YAML to JSON, a few extra elements are created: 

-  `iso8601` [formatted][1] from `date` using [Moment.js][2]
-  `preview` is first 70 or so characters of the actual raw markdown content, with ellipses at the end
-  `basename` is the filename without the path or extension

_Example_

```
% m2.js --help

  Usage: m2j [options] <files>

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number
    -w --width <int>         max width of preview text [70]
    -p --pretty              format JSON with newlines
    -o --outfile <filename>  filename to save json to [output.json]
    

% m2j.js lottery.ms
